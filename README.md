## The Game of Life
Devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway, this simple simulation offers a fun thing to watch as it is a zero-player game. It is powered by the pygame library.

## Langton's Ant
This Turing-machine generates a pattern according to the path of an ant on a grid.

## Brian's Brain
Similar to the Game of Life, this automaton works on three states instead of two; on, dying, and off.
